# Soccer Game

## Description
This is a soccer game where the player can move side to side and kick the ball. There is a goal that moves from side to side, and the objective is to score 10 goals. Each time the player scores a goal, the player’s speed increases. The player can fail up to 3 times, and if they fail more than that, they will have to start from the beginning.

The project is written in Java using the Swing library, with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each component of the game, from the field to the player and the ball, is built using OOP principles.

Additionally, threads are used to manage the movement of the player, ball, and goal without any interference between actions.

## System Requirements

- Swing library (included in JDK)

### Game Objective
